# True-False-Quiz repository
# I created a True/False Quiz over the summer
# I created a database with 120 True/False questiosn (60 true, 60 false)
# I wrote the main game in Java
# I learnt how to use JavaFX to create a modern graphical user interface
# The game selects 10 random and unique questions from the database
# And plays the main game 2 buttons: 1 for true and 1 for false
# A different message is displayed at the end of the game depending on the user's score
